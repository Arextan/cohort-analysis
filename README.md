# cohort-analysis

One project during my investment banking internship was creating a cohort analysis from a company's invoices. Each cohort was derived from the vintage year a customer started doing business with the company. The purpose of the cohort analysis was to illustrate how long term and consistent new customer originations supported non-cyclical recurring revenue growth to potential buyers, which is seen in the Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM).

Previously, I painstaking constructed the analysis through intensive trial and error with Excel formulas. Now that I am learning Python, I have decided to come back to this dataset and use Pandas to wrangle the data, reconstruct the cohort analysis, and reproduce the relevant charts.
