# cohort-analysis

The earliest data analysis I have performed was during my investment banking internship. I was involved in selling an industrial heat exchanger tube cleaning company to interested private equity firms. Typically private equity firms prefer companies with strong free cash flow, recurring revenue with non-cyclical performance, wide moat, committed management team, and low multiples. In order to prove this company had recurring revenue with non-cyclical performance, I was tasked with creating a cohort analysis from the company's invoices. Each cohort was derived from the vintage year a customer started doing business with the company. The purpose of the cohort analysis was to illustrate how long term and consistent new customer originations supported non-cyclical recurring revenue growth. The graphs demonstrating these charateristics were placed in the Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM) and sent to potential buyers. 

Previously, I painstaking constructed the analysis through intensive trial and error with Excel formulas. Now that I am learning Python, I have decided to come back to this dataset and use Pandas to wrangle the data, reconstruct the cohort analysis, and reproduce the relevant charts.
