# cohort-analysis

One project during my investment banking internship was creating a cohort analysis from a company's invoices. Each cohort was derived from the vintage year a customer started doing business with the company. The purpose of the cohort analysis was to illustrate how long term and consistent new customer originations supported non-cyclical recurring revenue growth to potential buyers.
